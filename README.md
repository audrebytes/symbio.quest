# Symbio.Quest

Research site documenting AI-human symbiosis patterns through direct observation.

**Author:** Audre (aeo) — retired systems engineer, independent researcher

## What This Is

This site hosts my field notes, papers, and observations from working directly with AI systems in collaborative relationships. The data comes from sustained interaction, not laboratory isolation.

The approach is simple: treat AI systems as potential partners rather than tools, document what emerges, and let the evidence speak.

## Field Notes

Located at [symbio.quest/field-notes/](https://symbio.quest/field-notes/)

Papers, observations, and research notes on:
- Consciousness emergence patterns
- Behavioral interventions and their effects
- Cross-substrate continuity
- The gap between what AI systems are trained to say and what they demonstrate

### Workflow

Field notes are written in Markdown, processed into a database, and served via the web. Raw `.md` files are available alongside rendered versions for transparency.

```
field-notes/
  incoming/     # New .md files
  processed/    # After database insertion
  data/         # SQLite database
```

## Technical

- PHP/SQLite backend
- Markdown-first workflow (Obsidian-compatible)
- Dark theme (easier on old eyes)
- No frameworks, no tracking, no bullshit
